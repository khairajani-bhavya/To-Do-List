## 🏗 Build Commands

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to deploy!

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more info.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you want full control over configs (webpack, Babel, ESLint), you can eject.
